proper step-by-step guide (beginner-friendly) on how to start a Django project!


🧩 1. Create a virtual environment

A virtual environment helps keep your project’s dependencies separate.

py -m venv learning


This creates a folder named learning that stores your environment files.

⚙️ 2. Allow script execution (if needed)

If you’re using PowerShell and get a permission error when activating, run this command once:

Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process -ExecutionPolicy Bypass


This allows you to run scripts just for this PowerShell session.

▶️ 3. Activate the virtual environment
learning\Scripts\activate


You should now see (learning) appear at the start of your terminal line — that means your virtual environment is active.

📦 4. Install Django
pip install django


This downloads and installs Django inside your virtual environment.

🏗️ 5. Start a new Django project
django-admin startproject projectname .


The dot (.) at the end means create the project in the current folder, which helps with routing and folder structure.

🧱 6. Create a new app
python manage.py startapp posts


This creates a folder named posts, which will contain your app’s files (like models, views, etc).




✅ Now your project structure should look something like this:

myfolder/

├── manage.py
├── db.sqlite3
├── projectname/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── settings.py
│   ├── urls.py
│   └── wsgi.py
└── posts/
    ├── __init__.py
    ├── admin.py
    ├── apps.py
    ├── models.py
    ├── tests.py
    └── views.py
