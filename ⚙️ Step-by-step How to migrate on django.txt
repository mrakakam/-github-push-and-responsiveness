⚙️ Step-by-step: How to migrate

1. Make sure your virtual environment is active

You should see something like:

(learning) PS C:\Users\Admin\Documents\FunzoneEscort>


If not, activate it:

learning\Scripts\activate

2. Go to your project folder (where manage.py is)

For example:

cd C:\Users\Admin\Documents\FunzoneEscort

3. Run the first migrations (for Django’s built-in apps)

Before you add your own models, run this to set up Django’s default database tables:

python manage.py migrate


✅ This will create your database file (db.sqlite3) and apply all default migrations for:

Users & authentication

Sessions

Admin

Content types, etc.

4. Make migrations for your app

If you have models in your app (like in posts/models.py), run:

python manage.py makemigrations


This tells Django:

“Look at my models and prepare migration files for the database.”

You’ll see something like:

Migrations for 'posts':
  posts/migrations/0001_initial.py
    - Create model Post

5. Apply those migrations (update the database)
python manage.py migrate


This will now apply the new migrations to your database — actually creating the tables.
