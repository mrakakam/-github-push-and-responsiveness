⚙️ Step-by-step to run your Django server

1. Make sure your virtual environment is active

You should see something like this in your terminal:

(learning) PS C:\Users\Admin\Documents\YourProject>


If you don’t see (learning), activate it again:

learning\Scripts\activate


2. Run the server

In your project folder (where manage.py is located), run:

python manage.py runserver


3. Check the output

You’ll see something like this:

Watching for file changes with StatReloader
Performing system checks...

System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
